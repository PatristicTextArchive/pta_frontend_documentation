We look forward to adding further editions and translations of Christian texts from antiquity to the “Patristic Text Archive”:

If you would like to contribute, please contact [Annette von Stockhausen](mailto:annette.von_stockhausen@bbaw.de). All editions and translations published in the Patristic Text Archive must be licensed under an [open license](https://creativecommons.org/) (CC-BY, CC-BY-SA) and written in accordance with the [edition guidelines](../project/encoding-guidelines). We'll assist you, if you need help.

But you can also help on a small scale: The “Patristic Text Archive” is under construction and the texts are sure to contain errors. If you find an error, please report it [here](https://github.com/PatristicTextArchive/pta_data/issues) or (if you do not have a github account) by email to [Annette von Stockhausen](mailto:annette.von_stockhausen@bbaw.de).
