## Information On Data Protection

Every time the internet presence of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities is accessed by a user and every time a file is downloaded, for technical reasons data relating to this procedure are temporarily saved and processed in a protocol file.

Specifically, at every access/download, the following data are saved:
*  the IP address, which is (subsequently) anonymised,
*  date and time,
*  page accessed / name of file downloaded,
*  quantity of data transferred,
*  a message on whether the access/download was successful.
These data are evaluated only for statistical purposes and to improve the quality of service and are then destroyed. No other use is made of them and they are not passed to third-parties.

Cookies must be set for the correct functioning of some pages. These cookies do not contain any personal data and are not evaluated further. Since this is a technical necessity, no explicit consent is required from the user.
 
This website uses Matomo (formerly Piwik), an open source software for statistical analysis of visitor traffic. Matomo does not use tracker cookies (It works with the function: force tracking without cookies)! 
The IP address is anonymized immediately after processing and before it is stored.
